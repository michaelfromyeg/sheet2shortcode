<b>CPEN 281</b>
<i>Qi, Estella Hongxing</i>
CPEN 281 is a web-oriented technical communication course, blending synchronous and asynchronous leaning in a flipped classroom. The instructional material is posted on Canvas for students to study and review the course content; Discussion Board is used for peer-review of assignment drafts; the revised assignments are submitted to Assignment Dropbox for grading. The class meet via Collaborate Ultra for lectures, activities, discussions, and presentations. Office hours are also held via Collaborate Ultra for questions and answers. The final exam is administered using Proctorio via Canvas.

<b>CPEN 333</b>
<i>Davies, Paul</i>
Labs will be run as close as possible as per usual during Winter 2020. All dates, goals and objectives will be described on Canvas. Labs will be submitted via Canvas and graded by TAs. CPEN 333 is a programming course that uses Visual Studio and Visual Paradigm UML tools which are free to download and use. There will also be holding weekly meetings on-line, similar to a drop in tutorial if you have questions.
<br />
<b>CPEN 400</b>
<i>Quinton, Brad</i>
In the coming term, CPEN 400D will extend many of the online friendly practices that were already a part of the course in the past. There will be 6 assignments (roughly one every two weeks). These assignments were already designed to be completed completely online. By leveraging JupyterHub as a backend, the assignments can be accessed, completed, tested and submitted via any web browser. As in the past, all lectures will be recorded and posted. This term live lectures will be presented using Zoom instead of in-person and will feature interactive, real-time quizzes (for fun, not for marks...). Finally, TAs will host weekly "office hours" sessions via Zoom to help with assignments and clarifications of any lecture material.

<b>CPEN 421</b>
<i>Patrick Conroy</i>
Lectures will be made available on Canvas on a scheduled basis and will be supplemented with real-time and offline Q&A sessions, results made available on Canvas. Exams will be open book and offered for the usual contiguous duration but available non-invigilated anytime in a 24-hour period; exams will be calibrated to be more difficult than if they were invigilated and closed book. Assignments will probably be fewer and larger, covering multiple lesson elements.
<br />
<b>CPEN 422</b>
<i>Mesbah, Ali</i>
Lectures will contain a mix of activities and explanations to help keep everyone engaged. Assignments will be sometimes more concrete with a “right” answer, and others will be more open-ended that will involve exploration and creativity with code. For labs, you’ll use GitHub to submit work before given deadlines. The TA’s will grade work via running tests on the GitHub code.
<br />
<b>CPEN 481</b>
<i>Carmichael, Jeff</i>
CPEN 481 will be moving away from a course structure that heavily emphasizes the exams, focusing more on assignments and quizzes, so that learning is happening along the way. It'll also be incorporating more 'real life' examples. This course hasn't been too heavily impacted by the move to remote learning. We use Piazza a lot for dialogue and questions, and also are very interactive during lectures, using the chat window as a way to keep students up to speed and engaged.
