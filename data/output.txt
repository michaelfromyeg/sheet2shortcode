This technical communication course is already web-oriented, blending synchronous and asynchronous leaning in a flipped classroom. The instructional material is posted on Canvas for students to study and review the course content; Discussion Board is used for peer-review of assignment drafts; the revised assignments are submitted to Assignment Dropbox for grading. The class meet via Collaborate Ultra for lectures, activities, discussions, and presentations. Office hours are also held via Collaborate Ultra for questions and answers. The final exam is administered using Proctorio via Canvas.</p>

In the coming term, this course will extend many of the remote friendly practices that were already a part of the course in the past. There will be 6 assignments (roughly one every two weeks). These assignments were already designed to be completed completely remotely. By leveraging JupyterHub as a backend, the assignments can be accessed, completed, tested and submitted via any web browser. As in the past, all lectures will be recorded and posted. This term live lectures will be presented using Zoom instead of in-person and will feature interactive, real-time quizzes (for fun, not for marks...). Finally, TAs will host weekly "office hours" sessions via Zoom to help with assignments and clarifications of any lecture material.</p>

Lectures will be made available on Canvas on a scheduled basis and will be supplemented with real-time and offline Q&A sessions, results made available on Canvas. Exams will be open book and offered for the usual contiguous duration but available non-invigilated anytime in a 24-hour period; exams will be calibrated to be more difficult than if they were invigilated and closed book. Assignments will probably be fewer and larger, covering multiple lesson elements.</p>

Lectures will contain a mix of activities and explanations to help keep everyone engaged. Assignments will be sometimes more concrete with a “right” answer, and others will be more open-ended that will involve exploration and creativity with code. For labs, you’ll use GitHub to submit work before given deadlines. The TA’s will grade work via running tests on the GitHub code.</p>

This course will be moving away from a structure that heavily emphasizes the exams, focusing more on assignments and quizzes, so that learning is happening along the way. It'll also be incorporating more 'real life' examples. This course hasn't been too heavily impacted by the move to remote learning. We use Piazza a lot for dialogue and questions, and also are very interactive during lectures, using the chat window as a way to keep students up to speed and engaged.</p>

Many diverse companies were increasingly moving to remote collaboration on projects even before the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend is accelerated due to current social distancing requirements. Capstone will equip students with remote collaboration best practices to serve them during their project and as they transition to the next phase of their career. Prototyping a physical product is a tried and true way of validating a design. However simulation packages are increasing in sophistication and are able to predict many types of design failures quickly in a cost effective way. The Capstone course will guide students on how to build validation into the design process using ECE's wide range of industry leading simulation software.</p>

Lectures and exams will be conducted remotely.  Laboratories will be remote also, which is a much bigger challenge.  For this reason we are preparing a couple of lab kits that will allow you to do all the required experiments at home.  One kit contains all the needed components, such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc. as well as tools, bread boards, and wires. The other kit includes a multi-meter, as well as an USB oscilloscope and a signal generator designed and built specifically for the course.  You will be notified soon on how to buy the kits and get them delivered.</p>

This course provides fundamental knowledge about semiconductors, metals, magnetic materials and insulators that make up all the devices we use. The course is well suited for remote delivery. It will be hosted on Canvas, where video lectures with concurrent participation quizzes and weekly live tutorial sessions will be hosted. We will make use of PhET simulations. For tutorials we will use Collaborate Ultra or similar, moderated by the instructor and/or TAs. Instructional material will be posted on Canvas for students to study and review content. Assignments will be submitted online using combined automatic grading (Canvas or WebWork) and solution upload. Proctoring of exams will be done through Zoom or another means.

As we adapt to remote learning, several changes are being introduced to this course. Firstly, the course is adopting a flipped classroom format and placing greater emphasis on guided discussions during class time. Secondly, this course is adopting a new course textbook: 'Frank Gross, Smart Antennas with Matlab, 2nd ed, McGraw-Hill, 2015.' Thirdly, the syllabus is being upgraded to include new material on 5G wireless, spectrum management and smart antennas.

Lectures will be given via teleconference and ideally a TA will be available for Q&A in real time. The instructor will record the lectures and make them available to the students to watch afterwards but the there is also a plan to give attendance points for being present as that is the primary means of engaging with students and the lecture material synchronously. The instructor is converting some of the individual assignments into team assignments to encourage community building. There is still a plan to have individual submissions and at least one individual assignment. Additionally, there will be one team design submission around an online or numerical tool of nanoelectronic devices/circuits. Professor Walus plans to reduce the number of lectures where he is presenting and hopefully increase the number of lectures where industry experts are present. He plans to run that part of the course as a fireside chat with experts.</p>
